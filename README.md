Automate renaming pokemon in pokemon go with pokegenie

## Requirements ##

* Powershell
* Android device with adb enabled and working

## How to Use ##

Download the powershell script and update all the coordinates with the appropriate coordinates for your phone.  I wrote this to the exact coordinates for my phone (OnePlus 6T), and unless you happen to have the exact same phone this script will probably not work for you.

You can enable touch coordinates in the Android developer menu: https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#input

Go through the steps and fix the x/y coordinates on your phone in the script so that the touch input works as expected.

You can run the powershell script and CTRL+C it to stop it if it starts mis-clicking or if it's done.
