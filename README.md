Automate renaming pokemon in pokemon go with pokegenie

## Requirements ##

* Powershell
* Android device with adb enabled and working

## How to Use ##

Clone the powershell script and update all the coordinates with the appropriate coordinates for your phone.  I wrote this to the exact coordinates for my phone (OnePlus 6T), and unless you happen to have the exact same phone this script will probably not work for you.

You can enable touch coordinates in the Android developer menu: https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#input
